This was an activity for merging RStudio with git using Gitbash as per John Hopkins university R programming course or more precisely The Data Scientist Toolbox.
The .R file prints two statements and based on the output, this activity is submitted for peer evaluation.

print("This file was created within RStudio")

print("And now it lives on GitHub")
